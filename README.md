Flexibly configure output of `toString` method (with or without code generation) (with or without mixin).

You can choose either to use code generator or not.

If you want to generate code, you also need the package
[to_string_helper_generator](https://pub.dev/packages/to_string_helper_generator).
Otherwise, you only need the package [to_string_helper](https://pub.dev/packages/to_string_helper).

* [Example - without code generator](example_without_generator)
* [Example - with code generator](example_with_generator)
